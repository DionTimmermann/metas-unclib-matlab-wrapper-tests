# metas-unclib-matlab-wrapper-tests
 Scripts to test if LinProp/DistProp/MCProp variables behave as expected in Matlab.
 
 To automatically run all tests (all calls to compare_* in all files starting with 'test_' in the sub-folder 'tests'), run the file 'run_all_tests.m'. The script will generate an excel file with the results of all tests, sorted by the result.
 To test individual functions, the scripts in the 'tests' sub-folder can be executed individually or opened using the live editor.
